- Decide list of sensors and components(Eg- engine->vibration, oil, temp, pressure, etc;fuel->fuel pressure, flow, etc.;humidity, temp, etc.)
- Get data for the sensors
- Code to take the data
- Code to create thresholds for all the data(their safe/permeable range)
- Train model on data to predict condition of vehicle, hours left, etc
- Display data maybe in a prototype UI(take the ui in documents as reference) or in a general form which displays which components are working fine and which have to be checked
along with prediction of remaining hours
